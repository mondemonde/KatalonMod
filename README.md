# KatalonMod
You can expand the Katalon capabilities by adding extension scripts.

We exploit this feature to customize Katalon to a specific project, just by adding one or two scripts we can automate the updates of useful test cases for our project. 

This will consolidate all test cases that would be considered as our standard test, so everyone is on the same page when testing.

However for this initial version, I would consider its use is more of smoke testing only.
